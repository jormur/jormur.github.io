# Abstract

Challenging conventional wisdom, this study unravels the complex relationships between partisan fragmentation across levels of government and organized crime's strategic use of political violence in Mexico. Leveraging a novel municipal-level dataset spanning 2018-2023 and employing synthetic difference-in-differences (SDID) estimation, we isolate the causal impacts of discrete "fragmentation shocks" on patterns of political violence. Contrary to expectations, we find that increased vertical misalignment between municipal and federal parties reduces violence targeting local authorities, suggesting criminal groups may favor cooption over confrontation amid disrupted power arrangements. While fragmentation appears to reduce threats to political elites, its effects on civilian victimization are less clear. These nuanced findings challenge prevailing theories about the relationship between political fragmentation and violence, offering new insights into how evolving partisan landscapes shape organized crime's incentives for anti-state coercion. Our results contribute to ongoing debates surrounding the political underpinnings of subnational conflicts and highlight the need for policymakers to consider the complex interplay between political structures, criminal behavior, and patterns of violence when designing interventions to strengthen democratic institutions and combat organized crime.
