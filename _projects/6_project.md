# Abstract

This study investigates the impact of variations in the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) payments, a unique form of universal basic income, on intra-state migration patterns among boroughs in Alaska. Employing a spatial panel data approach with origin-destination migration flow data from 2001 to 2023, the analysis examines the effects of PFD payments alongside factors such as population size, unemployment rates, and wage levels. While the results do not conclusively establish a significant relationship between PFD payment variations and migration flows, the analysis highlights the importance of population dynamics and wage levels in shaping mobility decisions. Despite its non-significant impact on migration, the PFD program's unconditional nature offers insights into promoting individual mobility and economic freedom.
