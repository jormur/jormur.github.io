This data was sourced from Kaggle, see [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishekvermasg1/goodreads-quotes.

We, as soulful beings, are quite fond of words of meaning and power, whether they be words of passion or inspiration. I thought it would be interesting to delve a bit into the trends found in the published quotes found on Goodreads, one of the most popular aggregators of this type of online content. This is just to serve as an object of curiosity as well as an opportunity for practice my data science skills.
