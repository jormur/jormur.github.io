This project applies advanced data science techniques to analyze what makes quotes go viral on Goodreads, combining traditional econometric methods with cutting-edge natural language processing. Using a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishekvermasg1/goodreads-quotes) of popular quotes from the platform, I investigated how content characteristics, emotional sentiment, and author influence affect engagement.

The analysis employs multiple methodological approaches:

Natural Language Processing (BERT) for sentiment analysis
Network analysis to map author relationships and influence
Machine learning for popularity prediction
Statistical analysis of quote characteristics
