This is a small practice project that I did to introduce myself to Tableau and to prepare myself for my internship interview. The project is a dashboard that visualizes the COVID-19 vaccination coverage around the world. The data is sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) and was updated during the peak rollout times. The dashboard includes a world map that shows the percentage of the population that has received at least one dose of the vaccine, a bar chart that shows the percentage of the population that is fully vaccinated, and a line chart that shows the daily number of vaccinations.
