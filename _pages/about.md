I'm a master's student in the [International Master’s Program of Applied Economics and Social Development](https://imes.nccu.edu.tw/) at National Chengchi University in Taipei, Taiwan.

Originally from Belize, I have been living in Taiwan for more than seven years now. In that time, I have attained a BSc in Management and Finance from [National Tsing Hua University](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/) in Hsinchu, Taiwan, as well as professional profiency in Mandarin Chinese (但熟能生巧！). Along with my studies, I have been interning for almost a year now as a data analyst at the Taipei Financial Center Corp. (Taipei 101). My research interests are in political economics and econometrics.

I'm personally interested in literature, film, and fitness!
