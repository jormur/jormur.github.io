I just graduated from the [International Master’s Program of Applied Economics and Social Development](https://imes.nccu.edu.tw/) at [National Chengchi University](https://www.nccu.edu.tw/) in Taipei, Taiwan. My research interests are in political economics and econometrics.

Originally from Belize, I have been living in Taiwan for more than 8 years now. In that time, along with my Master's, I have attained a BSc in Management and Finance from [National Tsing Hua University](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/) in Hsinchu, Taiwan, as well as professional proficiency in Mandarin Chinese (熟能生巧！).

During my studies, I interned for more than a year as a data analyst at the [Taipei Financial Center Corp. (Taipei 101)](https://www.taipei-101.com.tw/en/corporate) in the marketing department for the mall, serving world-famous brands as clients.

I'm personally interested in music, film, and basketball.
