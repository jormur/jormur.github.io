I'm a master's student in the [International Masterâ€™s Program of Applied Economics and Social Development](https://imes.nccu.edu.tw/) at National Chengchi University in Taipei, Taiwan.

A Belize City, Belize native, I have been living in Taiwan for more than six years now. In that time, I studied Mandarin Chinese and attained a BSc in Management and Finance from National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu, Taiwan. My research interests are in labor and political economics.

I'm personally interested in reading, art, and watches!
